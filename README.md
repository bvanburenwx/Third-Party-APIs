# Third-Party-APIs# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

This code is a simple scheduler. Upon opening the page, the user will see several different
time slots, which will look like the image below. The current date and time that the user opens
the site will display at the top of the page.

The user will also note that some time slots have background that are different colors. If the background color of the timeslot is Gray that means that this timeslot is in the past. If the timeslot background color is Red, that means the timeslot is the present. Lastly, if the timeslot background color is Green, that means the timeslot is in the future. 

For demostration purposes, the first images shows the time is currently 4:49PM. Based off the image, the 4PM timeslot is red, which indicates that this is the current timeslot. The user can also see that the 5PM timeslot is green, which shows that it is in the future, and the same with the 3PM timeslot being gray showing the past.

The user will also note that each timeslot text area has a save icon to the right. The user can click this after typing in a task and it will save the users input and display it on the screen, even if the screen is refreshed.
